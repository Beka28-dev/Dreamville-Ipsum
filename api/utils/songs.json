She makes this tea for us. It's day, for whatever reason I got a headache, crazy headache. So I told her, you know, I tell her I'ma chill out for a minute. Now the beats are banging down stairs and she's writing so it's all good. I'm just going to take a little breather, she comes up stairs, she fixed me some tea, noticed my voice changed, she fixed me some tea you know? She comes with me and next thing you know, I'm getting a massage  from Erykah Badu. Mmm, on top of me straddled on the couch. Now, nothing happened, it was just nice to have Erykah on my lap. Immediately after that we made the track \"Kiss Me On My Lap.\""]
